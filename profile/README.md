## **The team** üèÜ

**The team consists of 2 engineering students and crypto lovers.**

We are all students bound by our passion and commitment for blockchain and Web3. We want to develop innovative solutions that will help the whole ecosystem expand. Too many times have we seen privacy being set aside in projects, and we want to be able to change that. That is why Maxime and Thomas are proud to present you this solution for real privacy.

By addressing the need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem while having a real utility in our daily life, the Ripple Solvency Proof project has the potential to be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.
